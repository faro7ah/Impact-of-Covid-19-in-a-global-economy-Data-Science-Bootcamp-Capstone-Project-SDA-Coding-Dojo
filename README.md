# Project Motivation:
Is to study and understand the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the Global Economy, and how it has changed throughout one year. To better guide the analysis I formed the following questions:

- What Is The Total Rate Of The Human Development Index, Total cases, Total deaths, Stringency Index, And GDP Per Capita?
- What Is The Top 50 Countries According To The GDP Per Capita?
- What Is The Rate Of Total Deaths And Total Cases Under This Global Pandemic?
- What Is The Relationship Between GDP Per Capita And Human Development Index For Each Country Under Covid-19?
- What Is The Rate Of Stringency Index And GDP Per Capita According to Each Country?
