# Project Motivation:
Is to study and understand the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the Global Economy, and how it has changed throughout one year. To better guide the analysis I formed the following questions:

- What is the total rate of the human development index, total cases, total deaths, stringency index, and GDP per capita?
- What is the top 50 countries according to the GDP per capita?
- What Is the rate of total deaths and total cases under this global pandemic?
- What is the Relationship Between GDP Per Capita And Human Development Index For Each Country Under Covid-19?
- What is the rate of stringency index With the world average GDP per capita?
